I've become the Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. In this capacity, I'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I'll am given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. 

After aggregating the data, my conclusions for the school district are below. 

* Based on the data of the top and bottom perfroming school, district schools have a lower overall passing rate than charter schools.
* The table of Scores by the amount spent per student shows that the more the school allocated to each student the overall pass rating decreased. This data is very interesting because I thought as the more money invested per student the more resources a student would theoretically get giving them a better opportunity for passing.
* As the school size increases the trend shows that the pass rating decreases. If a parent was looking at this data they would want to enroll their child in a school with less than 2000 students to give their child the best opportunity for passing reading and math.
